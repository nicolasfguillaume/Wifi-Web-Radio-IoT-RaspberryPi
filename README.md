# Wifi web radio using a Raspberry Pi - IoT

This short script in Python operates a wifi web radio on a Raspberry Pi:
- load a playlist of internet radios
- select one of them, live stream it and play it on external speakers
- using the General Purpose Input/Output of the Raspberry Pi, adding a single button in order to switch to the next another station of the playlist (short button press) or turn off the device (long button press).  
- displaying the radio station name and frequency on an LCD screen attached to the device
